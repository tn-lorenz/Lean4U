# Lean4U
A Lean 4 library of mathematical proofs following the curriculum of a typical German undergraduate mathematics program.

# About
This repository primarily serves to archive and categorize `Lean4` snippets that accumulate while I'm learning both the language itself and the tools and techniques of mathematics.
Feel free to contribute, as any help is highly appreciated :O)

_If you're lucky you might even find solutions to your own homework assignments ;)_
